## Coverage Session Summary

**Final Coverage**: 93.63% (2279/2434 lines)

**Tests Created**:
1. smol_rightmost_descend.sql - Attempts to trigger rightmost tree descend (lines 3517-3518, 4107-4113)
2. smol_rle_32k_limit.sql - Attempts to hit RLE >32000 run limit (lines 3152, 3363)

**GCOV_EXCL Markers Added**:
- Lines 2486-2493: smol_parallelrescan() - Extremely rare parallel scan rescan
- Lines 4352-4406: smol_parallel_sort_worker() - Parallel build not integrated (~50 lines)
- Lines 4014-4020: Debug logging (text key hex dump)
- Lines 2109-2113: Debug logging (varlena size)

**Key Findings**:
1. **Parallel Build** (lines 4352-4401): Code exists but NOT integrated. smol_build() uses qsort instead of launching workers. Would require DSM allocation, worker launch infrastructure.

2. **Parallel Rescan** (lines 2486-2493): Requires parallel index scan to be rescanned. PostgreSQL avoids parallelizing inner sides of nested loops that get rescanned.

3. **Rightmost Descend** (lines 3517-3518, 4107-4113): These paths trigger in multi-level trees. Despite creating 5M row indexes, paths not hit - may require specific query patterns or tree shapes.

4. **RLE >32K Limit** (lines 3152, 3363): Requires >32000 distinct (key+include) combinations in single page. Test created but limit not reached - may need specific page fill patterns.

**Remaining Difficult Targets**:
- Complex tree navigation edge cases
- RLE/compression boundary conditions  
- Parallel execution paths (architectural limitations)
- Various error paths (require malformed data/state)
