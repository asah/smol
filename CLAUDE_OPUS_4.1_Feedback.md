Current Capability Assessment
Strengths

Solid Core Architecture: The read-only, TID-less design achieves its primary goal of space efficiency. The implementation correctly handles the PostgreSQL AM interface, including proper executor integration via synthetic TIDs and VM manipulation.
Significant Space Savings: Achieving ~46% space reduction (574 MB vs 1067 MB for 50M SMALLINT rows) by eliminating 8-byte TID overhead per tuple is substantial and well-executed.
Performance Wins: The 10x+ speedup for full scans (5.3s vs 59.5s) demonstrates the value of better cache locality and eliminating heap fetches. The parallel scan implementation with chunked scheduling is competent.
Correctness: The implementation properly enforces invariants (no NULLs, fixed-width only), implements proper sorting with opclass comparators, and handles scan semantics correctly.

Weaknesses

Limited Optimization Depth: While the basics are solid, there's significant untapped performance potential in vectorization, prefetching, and CPU optimization.
No Crash Safety: Lack of WAL logging makes this unsuitable for production use.
Primitive Cost Model: The planner integration uses hardcoded estimates that don't reflect actual performance characteristics.
Missing Advanced Features: No compression, no bloom filters, no zone maps - features that could provide order-of-magnitude improvements for analytical workloads.

High-ROI Improvements (Sorted by Impact)
1. Vectorized Scan Operations (50-200% speedup potential)

What: Process tuples in batches of 256-1024 using SIMD instructions for comparisons and aggregations
Why High ROI: Modern CPUs can compare 8 int32s simultaneously with AVX2. Current tuple-at-a-time processing leaves 8x performance on the table
Implementation: Add vectorized paths for common predicates (range scans, equality) and aggregates (SUM, COUNT, MIN/MAX)

2. Zone Maps / Min-Max Indexes (10-100x speedup for selective queries)

What: Store min/max values per page or page group in metapage, enabling page-level pruning
Why High ROI: Skip entire pages that can't contain matching values. For a query like "WHERE id BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000" on a 1M row table, could skip 99% of pages
Implementation: Already partially there with the directory structure - extend to all attributes and make it hierarchical

3. Compression (2-4x space reduction, 2-3x scan speedup)

What: Apply lightweight compression (bit-packing, dictionary encoding, RLE) to data pages
Why High ROI: Further space reduction improves cache efficiency. For low-cardinality columns, dictionary encoding could achieve 10x compression
Implementation: Start with simple schemes like bit-packing for small integers, then add dictionary encoding for repeated values

4. Asynchronous I/O with io_uring (30-50% speedup for I/O-bound scans)

What: Use io_uring for batched, asynchronous page reads instead of synchronous ReadBuffer calls
Why High ROI: Eliminate I/O stalls by having multiple requests in flight. Particularly effective for parallel scans
Implementation: Batch page requests and use io_uring_submit for bulk submission

5. WAL Logging (Required for production)

What: Implement proper WAL logging for crash safety
Why High ROI: Without this, the entire system is unusable in production environments
Implementation: Use generic WAL or implement custom WAL records for page modifications

6. Adaptive Execution (20-40% speedup)

What: JIT-compile hot scan predicates, choose between branching vs branchless comparisons based on selectivity
Why High ROI: Eliminate interpreter overhead for complex predicates. Branch prediction failures currently cost 10-20 cycles per misprediction
Implementation: Use LLVM infrastructure already in PostgreSQL for JIT compilation

7. Multi-Version Support (Enables updates without full rebuild)

What: Support incremental updates via version chains or delta storage
Why High ROI: Currently requires full index rebuild for any data change. This makes it impractical for many use cases
Implementation: Add delta pages that overlay base data, merge periodically

8. Bloom Filters for Multi-Column Predicates (10-50x for complex filters)

What: Build bloom filters per page for multi-attribute queries
Why High ROI: Enable fast page pruning for complex predicates that zone maps can't handle
Implementation: Store compact bloom filters in metapage or separate filter pages

9. Column Group Storage (2-3x speedup for projection queries)

What: Store attributes in column groups rather than row-wise to improve cache locality for queries touching few columns
Why High ROI: Queries scanning only 2 of 10 columns currently read unnecessary data
Implementation: Reorganize page layout to group columns, add column-level iteration

10. Cost Model Calibration (Better plan selection)

What: Implement accurate cost estimation based on actual I/O and CPU costs
Why High ROI: Currently the planner may choose suboptimal plans. Accurate costs ensure SMOL is chosen when appropriate
Implementation: Measure actual costs, implement selectivity estimation, factor in compression/zone maps

Not Worth Pursuing (Low ROI)

Further micro-optimizations to current scan loop (< 5% improvement)
Support for varlena types without fundamental redesign
Bitmap scan support (conflicts with design goals)
Minor GUC tuning adjustments

The top 5 improvements could collectively provide 10-100x performance improvements for typical analytical queries while maintaining or improving space efficiency. The key insight is that the current implementation, while correct, operates at the granularity of 1960s-era row-at-a-time processing when modern hardware and techniques enable batch processing at much higher efficiency.
