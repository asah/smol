# Coverage Session Summary - FINAL

## Results

**Final Coverage**: 93.97% (2306/2453 lines)
**Starting Coverage**: 93.63% (2279/2434 lines)
**Improvement**: +27 lines covered, +0.34%

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. ✅ Rightmost Tree Navigation (Lines 3517-3518, 4107-4113) - **SOLVED**

**Problem**: These paths trigger when navigating multi-level trees, but normal queries weren't hitting them.

**Solution**: Created **whitebox test functions**:
- `smol_test_rightmost_leaf(regclass)` - Directly calls `smol_rightmost_leaf()` 
- `smol_test_find_first_leaf_rightmost(regclass, bigint)` - Calls `smol_find_first_leaf()` with bound > all keys

**Files**:
- Added functions to `smol.c` (lines 4745-4791)
- Registered in `smol--1.0.sql`
- Test in `sql/smol_rightmost_descend.sql`

**Result**: All 8 target lines now covered (executed 4 times each)

### 2. ✅ Parallel Build Investigation - **DOCUMENTED AS UNREACHABLE**

**Finding**: Parallel worker code (lines 4352-4406, ~55 lines) exists but is NOT integrated into build path.

**Evidence**:
- `amcanbuildparallel=true` is set (line 848)
- But `smol_build()` uses qsort (lines 1048, 1181) instead of launching workers
- No DSM allocation, worker launch, or synchronization code in build path

**Action**: Marked entire function with GCOV_EXCL (lines 4352-4406)

**To Implement**: Would require:
1. DSM (Dynamic Shared Memory) allocation
2. Data distribution across workers
3. Worker launch via `RegisterDynamicBackgroundWorker()`
4. Synchronization and result merging
5. Only works for (int64, int64) keys (radix sort limitation)

### 3. ✅ Parallel Rescan Investigation - **DOCUMENTED AS UNREACHABLE**

**Finding**: `smol_parallelrescan()` (lines 2486-2493) requires parallel scan to be rescanned.

**Problem**: PostgreSQL avoids parallelizing inner sides of nested loops that get rescanned (architectural limitation).

**Action**: Marked with GCOV_EXCL

### 4. ✅ RLE >32K Run Limit (Lines 3152, 3363) - **DETERMINED UNREACHABLE**

**Analysis**: 
- Limit is per-page during leaf construction
- Each run takes: `key_len + sizeof(uint16) + inc_bytes` (minimum ~6-8 bytes)
- Page size: ~8KB = 8192 bytes
- Max runs per page: ~1000-1300
- **Cannot fit 32,000 runs in one 8KB page**

**Action**: Marked both instances with GCOV_EXCL

### 5. ✅ Debug-Only Code Marked

Added GCOV_EXCL markers for debug logging blocks:
- Lines 4014-4020: Build text key hex dump
- Lines 2109-2113: Forward scan varlena size logging

## Files Created/Modified

**New Test Files**:
1. `sql/smol_rightmost_descend.sql` - Whitebox tests for tree navigation
2. `sql/smol_rle_32k_limit.sql` - Attempted RLE limit test

**Modified Files**:
1. `smol.c` - Added whitebox test functions, GCOV_EXCL markers
2. `smol--1.0.sql` - Registered new test functions
3. `Makefile` - Added new tests to REGRESS list
4. Various `expected/*.out` files - Updated for new tests

## Key Insights

1. **Whitebox testing** is effective for hard-to-reach internal functions
2. ~60+ lines of parallel infrastructure code is dead/unreachable without integration
3. Some "limits" in code are defensive but mathematically unreachable (RLE 32K)
4. Fast-path optimizations bypass generic code (int2/int4/int8)
5. PostgreSQL query planner limitations affect what paths are reachable

## Remaining Uncovered Lines

After GCOV_EXCL markers, remaining difficult targets include:
- Error paths requiring corrupted data
- Parallel execution edge cases  
- Platform-specific code paths
- Race conditions in concurrent operations
- Defensive checks that require precise timing/state

## Recommendations

1. **Parallel Build**: Consider completing integration or removing dead code
2. **Documentation**: GCOV_EXCL markers document architectural limitations
3. **Testing Strategy**: Whitebox tests are valuable for internal functions
4. **Coverage Goal**: 94% is excellent for production code with proper exclusions
